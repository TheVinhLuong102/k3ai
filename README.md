# k3ai

K3ai aim to simplify access to AI tools and platforms. You select the tool, we take care of everything else.

## Getting started

This project requires Go to be installed. On OS X with Homebrew you can just run `brew install go`.

Running it then should be as simple as:

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/k3ai
```

### Testing

``make test``

### Special Mentions

Initial project was made by @GSantomaggio and @alefesta in two weeks time. While a refactoring was possible, it was determined
it would be easier to re-write from scratch the code.

Special thanks to https://github.com/lacion/cookiecutter-golang for inventing the golang cookiecutter, that saved a lot of time in setting 
up the project.
